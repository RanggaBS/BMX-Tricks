## Description

Bringing back the cut BMX trick feature.

Lost but not deleted. Bully has BMX trick animations that were never used. This mod finally lets you play it.

Bully Anniversary Edition touchscreen users are also supported. This mod also fixes the touchscreen Bully AE issue where you can't perform endo/stoppie.
